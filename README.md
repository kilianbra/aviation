# Aviation Model Documentation

Welcome to the Aviation Model project! This repository contains documentation and a simple model for global aviation operations, designed to be easy to understand and extend.

## Project Overview

This project provides:
- A basic model for global aviation operations
- Documentation written in Markdown, served using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/)
- Easy setup for local development and contribution

## Developer Guide

### Prerequisites
- [Python 3.7+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)

### 1. Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/aviation.git
cd aviation
```

### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment
It is recommended to use a Python virtual environment to manage dependencies:

#### On Windows:
```sh
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```
#### On macOS/Linux:
```sh
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```sh
pip install mkdocs
```

### 4. Serve the Documentation Locally
```sh
mkdocs serve
```
This will start a local server (usually at [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000)) where you can view and edit the documentation live.

### 5. Build the Documentation (Optional)
To generate a static site:
```sh
mkdocs build
```
The output will be in the `site/` directory.
