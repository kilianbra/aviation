# Simple Global Aviation Model

This document outlines a basic model for global aviation operations based on fundamental parameters and simple calculations.

## Global Constants

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Days per year | 365 |

## Model Inputs

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Passengers per year | Total number of passengers transported globally per year |
| Average flight length (km) | Mean distance of flights in kilometers |
| Aircraft flights per day | Number of flights each aircraft makes per day |
| Average seats per aircraft | Mean seating capacity of aircraft |

## Model Equations

The model uses two fundamental equations to calculate key aviation metrics:

### Passengers per Day
\[
\text{passengers per day} = \frac{\text{passengers per year}}{\text{days per year}}
\]

### Required Global Fleet Size
\[
\text{Required Global Fleet} = \frac{\text{passengers per day}}{\text{seats per aircraft} \times \text{flights per aircraft per day}}
\]

## Model Description

This simple model calculates the theoretical minimum number of aircraft required to transport all global passengers based on:
- Annual passenger volume
- Daily passenger distribution (assuming uniform distribution)
- Aircraft utilization (flights per day)
- Aircraft capacity (seats per aircraft)

The model assumes perfect efficiency with no consideration for factors such as:
- Route optimization
- Aircraft positioning
- Maintenance downtime
- Load factors
- Seasonal variations
